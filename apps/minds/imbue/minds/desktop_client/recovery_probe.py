"""Recovery diagnostics probe.

Powers the workspace-recovery page's diagnostics list. The endpoint reads
the outer host/provider state from the passive discovery resolver (a single
sampler shared with the rest of minds -- no synchronous ``mngr list``) and
runs a batched in-container probe via ``mngr exec`` only when that outer
state is healthy, then returns a flat list of named probes -- each capturing
the question asked, the command (or pseudo-command label) that produced the
data, the raw output captured, and a derived yes/no/unknown answer.

The recovery-page client renders each probe row as a question with a
check / x / question-mark indicator and an expandable command + output
panel. The page's restart-tier branching keys off a single derived
``dispatch_tier`` field so the rendering stays a pure projection of the
probe data, not a parallel set of natural-language fields.

The single sentinel ``===PROBE-READY===`` is printed before the in-container
JSON payload. If the sentinel is absent from stdout, the "Can we run a
command inside the container?" probe answers ``no`` -- the ``mngr exec``
plumbing returned without ever invoking the in-container script, so we
have no in-container observations and the page steers the user to a host
restart rather than auto-dispatching surgical.

    Ordered by precedence:

    * BACKEND_UNREACHABLE beats every other tier: if the provider that produces
      the host-state observations is itself unreachable (or rejecting us), no
      restart routed through it can help and the host-state probes cannot be
      trusted, so the provider-error signal wins outright. We do not sub-classify
      by error kind (a stopped daemon, a paused daemon, an expired login all land
      here): the user-facing impact is identical -- show the provider's own
      message, offer Retry, and wait for it to recover.
    * HEALTHY / INTERFACE_UNRESPONSIVE next, whenever the batched exec reached the
      container (``can_run`` is YES). Direct in-container evidence is authoritative
      regardless of snapshot freshness or how we got here: the container is
      demonstrably up, so a live GET / 200 is proof the interface is answering
      (HEALTHY, sent home) and a non-200 is the wedge a surgical in-place restart
      fixes (INTERFACE_UNRESPONSIVE). Positive evidence short-circuits every
      host-state-derived tier below.
    * INDETERMINATE when we have no direct in-container evidence AND cannot trust a
      negative verdict: the probe timed out (it observed *nothing* -- a timeout is
      absence of evidence, not evidence of a down workspace), or no discovery
      snapshot taken at/after the outage onset backs the host state (a pre-outage
      snapshot still reads the stale host state). A verdict or auto-restart off
      such non-evidence is the misclassification we avoid; the recovery page keeps
      checking instead.
    * HOST_OFFLINE when the container is offline (and we trust that observation):
      nothing live to interrupt, so a host restart can run unattended.
    * HOST_UNRESPONSIVE when the container claims running but the exec cleanly
      failed to reach it (ssh dead), or on any other ambiguous but trusted host
      state: a host restart bounces a live container, so it requires explicit user
      consent.
